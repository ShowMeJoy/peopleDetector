# 🛰️ People Detector API

This project is a simple object detection microservice built with **YOLOv8** and **FastAPI**.  
It allows you to upload an image and get back object detection results — either in **JSON** or as a **processed image with bounding boxes**.

> 🔧 The goal is to prepare for real-time ML inference on a Raspberry Pi using a lightweight object detection pipeline.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Object detection using a YOLOv8 model (trained on people)
- 📦 REST API with FastAPI
- 🖼️ Two endpoints:
  - `/predict`: returns detection results as JSON
  - `/predict-image`: returns image with drawn bounding boxes
- 🔒 Private paths and tokens are managed in `private_paths.py` (excluded from Git)

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- FastAPI + Uvicorn
- OpenCV (for drawing boxes)
- torch + torchvision (CUDA enabled)
